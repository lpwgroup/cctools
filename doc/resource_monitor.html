      <b>resource_monitor</b> is a tool to monitor the computational
      resources used by the process created by the command given as an
      argument, and all its descendants.  The monitor works
      'indirectly', that is, by observing how the environment changed
      while a process was running, therefore all the information
      reported should be considered just as an estimate (this is in
      contrast with direct methods, such as ptrace). It works on 
      Linux, and can be used in stand-alone mode, or automatically with
      <tt>makeflow</tt> and <tt>work queue</tt> applications.
      <p>

      <b>resource_monitor</b> generates up to three log files: a JSON encoded
      summary file with the maximum values of resource used and the time they
      occurred, a time-series that shows the resources used at given time
      intervals, and a list of files that were opened during execution.
      <p>

      Additionally, <b>resource_monitor</b> may be set to produce measurement
      snapshots according to events in some files (e.g., when a file is
      created, deleted, or a regular expression pattern appears in the file.). 

      Maximum resource limits can be specified in the form of a file, or a
      string given at the command line. If one of the resources goes over the
      limit specified, then the monitor terminates the task, and reports which
      resource went over the respective limits.
      <p>


      In systems that support it, <b>resource_monitor</b> wraps some
      libc functions to obtain a better estimate of the resources used.
      <p>

		  <h2 id="installation">Installation<a class="sectionlink" href="#installation" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

      The <b>resource_monitor</b> is included in the <b>current development version</b> of
      <a href="http://http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/download.shtml">CCTools</a>. For installation, please follow these <a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/install.html">instructions.</a>

	  <h2 id="running">Running resource_monitor<a class="sectionlink" href="#running" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

     Simply type:

      <code>% resource_monitor -O mymeasurements -- ls</code>

      This will generate the file mymeasurements.summary, describing the resource usage of the command "ls".


      <code>% resource_monitor -O mymeasurements --with-time-series --with-inotify -O mymeasurements -- ls</code>

     This will generate three files describing the resource usage of
     the command "ls". These files are <tt>
mymeasurements.summary</tt>, <tt>
mymeasurements.series</tt>, and <tt>mymeasurements.files,</tt> in
which PID represents the
corresponding process id. 

    By default, measurements are taken every second, and each time an event
    such as a file is opened, or a process forks, or exits.  We can specify the
    output names, and the sampling intervals:

      <code>% resource_monitor -O log-sleep -i 2 -- sleep 10</code>

      The previous command will monitor "sleep 10", at two second
      intervals, and will generate the
      files <tt>log-sleep.summary</tt>, <tt>log-sleep.series</tt>,
      and <tt>log-sleep.files</tt>.


      The monitor assumes that the application monitored is not interactive. To
      change this behaviour use the <tt>-f</tt> switch:

      <code>% resource_monitor -O mybash -f -- /bin/bash</code>


<h2 id="outputformat">Output Format<a class="sectionlink" href="#outputformat" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

      The summary is JSON encoded and includes the following fields:

<code>command:                  the command line given as an argument
start:                    time at start of execution, since the epoch
end:                      time at end of execution, since the epoch
exit_type:                one of "normal", "signal" or "limit" (a string)
signal:                   number of the signal that terminated the process
                          Only present if exit_type is signal

memory:                   maximum resident size across all processes
swap_memory:              maximum swap usage across all processes
bytes_read:               amount of data read from disk
bytes_written:            amount of data written to disk
bytes_received:           amount of data read from network interfaces
bytes_sent:               amount of data written to network interfaces
bandwidth:                maximum bandwidth used
total_files:              total maximum number of files and directories of
                          all the working directories in the tree
disk:                     size of all working directories in the tree

                          snapshot_name (JSON object)
</code>

      The time-series log has a row per time sample. For each row, the columns have the following meaning:

      <code>
wall_clock                the sample time, since the epoch, in microseconds

</code>

<h2 id="specifyinglimits">Specifying Resource Limits<a class="sectionlink" href="#specifyinglimits" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

Resource limits can be specified with a JSON object in a file in the same
format as the <a href="#outputformat"> output format </a>. Only resources
specified in the file are enforced.  Thus, for example, to automatically kill a
process after one hour, or if it is using 5GB of swap, we can create the
following file <tt>limits.json</tt>:

<code>{
    "wall_time": [3600, "s"],
    "swap_memory": [5, "GB"]
}
</code>


<code>resource_monitor -O output --monitor-limits=limits.json -- myapp </code>


<h2 id="specifyinglimits">Snapshots<a class="sectionlink" href="#snapshots" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

The resource_monitor can be directed to take snapshots of the resources used
according to the files created by the processes monitored. The typical use of
monitoring snapshots is to set a watch on a log file, and generate a snapshot
when a line in the log matches a pattern.
<br>
For example, assume that <tt>myapp</tt> goes through three stages during
execution: start, processing, and analysis, and that it indicates the current
stage by writing a line to <tt>my.log</tt> of the form <tt># STAGE</tt>. We
can direct the resource_monitor to take a snapshot at the beginning of each
stage as follows:

<code> snapshots.json:<code>
{
    "my.log":
        {
            "events":[
                {
                    "label":"file-created",
                    "on-creation":true
                },
                {
                    "label":"started",
                    "on-pattern":"^# START"
                },
                {
                    "label":"end-of-start",
                    "on-pattern":"^# PROCESSING"
                }
                {
                    "label":"end-of-processing",
                    "on-pattern":"^# ANALYSIS"
                }
                {
                    "label":"file-deleted",
                    "on-deletion":true
                }
            ]
        }
}
</code>
</code>


<code>resource_monitor -O output --snapshots-file=snapshots.json -- myapp </code>

Snapshots are included in the output summary file as an array of JSON objects under the key <tt>snapshots</tt>. Additionally, each snapshot is written to a file <tt>output.snapshot.N</tt>, where <tt> N </tt> is 0,1,2,...

	  <h3 id="running.makeflow"> Makeflow mode <a class="sectionlink" href="#running.makeflow" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

	  If you already have a makeflow file, you can activate the
	  resource_monitor by giving the <tt>--monitor</tt> option to makeflow with a
	  desired output directory, for example:

	  In this case, makeflow wraps every command line rule with the monitor,
	  and writes the resulting logs per rule in the directory
	  <tt>monitor_logs</tt>.

	  <h3 id="running.wq"> Work-queue mode <a class="sectionlink" href="#running.wq" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

      From Work Queue:

<code>q = work_queue_create(port);
work_queue_enable_monitoring(q, some-log-file, /* kill tasks on exhaustion */ 1);
</code>

      wraps every task with the monitor, and appends all generated
      summary files into the file <tt>some-log-file</tt>. Currently
      only summary reports are generated from work queue.

	  <h2 id="running.condor"> Monitoring with Condor <a class="sectionlink" href="#running.condor" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

      Unlike the previous examples, when using
      the <tt>resource_monitor</tt> directly with <b>condor</b>, you
      have to specify the <tt>resource_monitor</tt> as an input file,
      and the generated log files as output files. For example,
      consider the following submission file:

      <code>universe = vanilla
executable = matlab
arguments = -r "run script.m"
output = matlab.output
transfer_input_files=script.m
should_transfer_files = yes
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
log = condor.matlab.logfile
queue
</code>

      This can be rewritten, for example, as:

<code> universe = vanilla
executable = resource_monitor
arguments = -O matlab-resources --limits-file=limits.json -r "run script.m"
output = matlab.output
transfer_input_files=script.m,limits.json,/path/to/resource_monitor
transfer_output_files=matlab-resources.summary
should_transfer_files = yes
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
log = condor.matlab.logfile
queue
</code>
